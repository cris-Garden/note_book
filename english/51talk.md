Now **I am usually the one who cooks for the family** during the holldays.

Now problem is a lot of restaurants use peanut oil to cook their food and I am allergic to nuts.

I just want a little piece of the cake. It's too **oil** to eat a lot

She can't eate peanuts. She is **allegic** to nuts.

These noodles are both sweet and **salty**.

Tim likes baseball,basketball,tennis and football. He is **a** big **sports** person.


I am not very good at cooking when i first started to learn. Sometimes my food would be too salty or too oil. After a few months of practice , I can finally make food that tastes just right.
